  🌱 I am passionate about exploring numbers to extract meaningful information,  using  data to  solve real world problems and making informed decisions.
 
   :bar_chart:   Due to the rapid advancements in technology and the imperative for businesses to make accurate predictions, draw conclusions, and execute well-informed decisions to achieve their objectives, I decided to immerse myself in the realm of data analytics.
 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Life Data Project with start up founders and Business Owners.
